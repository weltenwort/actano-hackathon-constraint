# actano-hackathon-constraint

This is the proof-of-concept [GNU Prolog](http://www.gprolog.org/) code created
by the constraint programming team during the hackathon on October 20, 2015.

The file `test1.pl` contains predicates used for modelling a basic plan using
finite domain constraints. In addition the goals `example1` through `example4`
were used during the presentation to show the results.

## Running the examples

To interactively execute the first example use

```
$ gprolog --consult-file test1.pl --query-goal "example1"
```
